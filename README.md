# [Portfolio](https://aemann2.github.io/portfolio/)

A portfolio for my projects. Not every project is included here -- I've focused on the work I think is most unique, and I've tried to vary the types of projects I've included. It's a work in progress and I'll be adding to it as I apply for jobs and beyond.

## Background:

I'd seen one project page somewhere that featured the desktop / mobile photos, and a different project page that had animated screenshots. I decided to combine the two ideas in my _Projects_ section. Right now, the videos don't work very well because they take too long to load, but I plan to convert them to `.gif` images so they're quicker.

I'm not sure if I love the way the navbar looks...the text is a little hard to read when it overlaps with the text already on the page, so I might end up adding a background to the nav bar, or adding a SASS function to detect the BG color and change accordingly. Also, I need to put a picture of myself in the _About Me_ section so people don't think I'm some kind of cat animorph.

## Technology:

HTML, CSS, SASS

## What I learned or used for the first time:

- **SASS**
- **A costom favicon**
- **`Mix-blend-mode`**
- **Autoplaying embedded video**
- **Button animations**
- **Mobile hamburger menu**
